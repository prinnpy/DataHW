# Homework 06
> Build a dictionary class that reads in a list of unsorted 
words into a <list> STL (which is an implementation of a doubly linked list.)
from a file called dictionary.txtPreview the document.  Use a list of dictionary
entries (DictEntry). Next, sort the list.  The list STL has a member 
function .sort which works when overloadeding the < operator for the data 
type you are sorting).  Now, read a list of words from a file called findwords.txt
Preview the document. For each word in findwords.txt, search that list from the 
beginning of the list and if found, print (to the screen) how many 
searches/comparisons you had to make to find the word. Then search from the back of 
the list and print how many searches you had to make.
