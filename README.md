# Homework 02
> Add function where combining the two objects into one set by
overloading the  + (union) operator, and print out the union set.
The + operator must remove all duplicates from the result and
store one copy of any item. Also implement a subtraction operator
 where A - B means removing all elements that are in B from A.
If the item is in B but not A, it is not placed in the result.
Then remove the duplicates from the result, and print out the subtracted set.
